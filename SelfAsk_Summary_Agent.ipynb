      "ATP is vital for various cellular functions and is universally utilized by all known life forms. It is effective for quickly shifting energy but poor for storage, holding only one percent of a glucose molecule's energy at three times its mass. ATP is crucial for almost every process necessary for the survival of plants, fungi, bacteria, and animals. Without ATP, no life on Earth exists. Mitochondria reverse photosynthesis by combusting sugar molecules with oxygen to create new, energy-rich ATP molecules. This division of labor allows cells to have more energy available, enabling more complex evolution. Today, humans are composed of trillions of cells, each containing numerous machines that provide usable energy for survival. If ATP production is interrupted, even for a few minutes, it can lead to death.\n"

    "Ultimately, the quality of the reasoning provided by this Self Ask pipeline resides in the retrieval of appropriate examples to leverage for the few shot prompt. A larger dataset, as well as an optimal retrieval method from it, are the ultimate key for a successful Q&A. However, the intrinsic capability of improving the pipeline through augmenting the few shot dataset makes it very flexible for multiple use cases."
